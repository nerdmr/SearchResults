#Search Results Solution#

##Overview##

This repository represents a dynamically loaded search solution. The results and rendering code are outsourced to a third party service. The search query itself is static along with most of the page with the exception of in-page user interactions.

##Demo##

##Technical##

Index.html includes just a few scripts in addition to the static content that came when the page was saved. The bulk of the code that renders results lives in Scripts/SearchRender.ts.
